# Starbucks-Intern
UX / UI design for Starbucks Intern, a coffee and food delivery service for Starbucks customers

Flow for new Interns who want to sign up for the service: 
index.html > Sign Up > Continue > Front pic > Back pic > Terms & Conditions > Submit > Exit to Home
1) This will take you to the landing page where the app will open for Intern from this point on.
2) Until background check is completed and an email verification is received, this page will be unavailable to Intern. 

If you select "Go to Starbucks App":
Go to Starbucks App > Order > Espresso Drinks > Delivery 
1) At this point, you can select to either share the order or go directly to the "My Intern" page.

When editing a route:
1) Some of the Add buttons will be not be functional; this is to keep a linear flow for this prototype. However, if you select top-left, middle, and bottom-right in that order, it will flow properly.

The rest of the app is pretty self-explanatory. Explore and enjoy.
